**Platform Improvement**

Extra Credit Applied:
EC1 (1 point for doing both a & b): Using the same Objects layer, add new objects to the level, and new code into Platformer.js, to implement the following:
(a) A point object representing where the player should spawn. Have the player spawn there at the start of the game.
(b) One or more tile objects representing a player powerup. It should look different form the coins. The powerup should make the player jump higher (alter jump velocity temporarily).

EC2 (1 point) Make the coins juicy by creating a particle system which fires off when the player runs over a coin. Add the coin's score to the player score, and display that score on-screen.

EC3 (1 point) Animate the coins. Notice that the next tile in the tileset can be combined with the coin to create a simple two-frame animation. For giggles, animate the water surface as well (optional).
